# React Simple Project - Random Quotes Generator

This is just an usual react simple project that you've probably find on the internet. But in this project, i add some new features like switching quote categories, switch theme between dark and light theme using toggle, tweets the quote to Twitter, and save the quote as png.

For the quote, i use quotable API that you can find [here](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable). And for the save as an image feature, i use the dom-to-image library, you can see the documentation [here](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image).

If you want to see how the app looks like, you can go to the demo on this [link](https://ahmadfarhanstwn.github.io/react-quotes-generator-with-category/)
